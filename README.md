## General Information

* This is a project done for Code Fellows 401.ASP.Net course in advanced software development. It was designed as an educational tool to teach and experiment with the principles of Object Oriented Programming in C#. To do this we created an imaginary zoo and filled with with several animals. In our problem domain we mapped out the general flow of inheritence before getting started.

* On day two we went back and refactored all code to include interfaces as well as inheritence.

## Technologies Used

* This program was written entirely in C# 9.0 and .Net 5 on Visual Studio 2019.

## Features

* Can create instances of species objects, which all inherit props and methods from at least three levels up from the parent class Animal. Class can also be assigned interfaces.

## Setup

In order to use this project you will need to clone it from the Github Repo. At this point in time the program does not have a working executable file. It is meant to be used purely to play with class creation, inheritence, instancing, and interfaces.

## Usage

To use it simply clone the repo and edit the code inside of Visual Studio 2019.

## Project Status

Project is: Complete

## Room for Improvement

To do:
[x] Refactor to include interfaces.
